"Period_Calendar", This is my school project which I created on my own from scratch. 
My inspiration for this progarm was an app called "Period Tracker Period Calendar" which is easily available on Google Playstore. This "Period Tracker Period Calendar" application actually helps a women by predicting the upcoming dates of their menstrual cycle after taking some old data of the same from the user.

While this application provides the prediction of the dates of every upcoming month, my progarm "Period_Calendar" is just able to predict the dates of the next upcoming month of the date given by the user.
Although I'm aware that this isn't a very large scale program but it's accuracy is 100% if we compare its results with the "Period Tracker Period Calendar" application. And since I made this whole program on Python so there's no way possible that I've copied the source code of this application and also this isn't available anywhere online.
I've uploaded this here as its my first ever program that I've made on my own from scratch.
